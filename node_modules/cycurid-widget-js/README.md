# cycurid-widget-js

cycurid-widget-js is CycurID's solution to authentication and onboarding through the power of a Reusable Digital Identity Token. Users register with CycurID to create a Reusable Encrypted Zero-Knowledge Identity Token that they present to your company's onboarding or authentication platform, letting them seamlessly and instantly connect.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install cycurid-widget-js.

```bash
npm install cycurid-widget-js
```

## Usage

### Import
IMPORT IN REACT:
```javascript
import { immeOauth, immeLogout } from "cycurid-widget-js";
```

### Supported methods

#### immeOauth
This is the main function to use for authentication. Invoking this function will do the whole login flow and generate an access token, refresh token and access token expiry date. The token is then used to fetch the specified scope after successful login and verification by the user.
```javascript
import { immeOauth } from 'cycurid-widget-js';

const config = {
  action: '<YOUR_ACTION>',
  client_id: '<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>',
  client_secret: '<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>',
  origin_url: '<YOUR_ORIGIN_URL>',
  scopes: ['<YOUR_SCOPES_ARRAY>'],
  entity_name: '<YOUR_ENTITY_NAME>'
};

const onSuccess = (userInfo, token) => {<YOUR_ONSUCCESS_FUNCTION>}
const onFailure = (token) => {<YOUR_ONFAILURE_FUNCTION>}

const result = await immeOauth(config,onSuccess,onFailure);
```
#### immeLogout
This function will revoke the OAuth token.
```javascript
import { immeLogout } from 'cycurid-widget-js';

const logout = await immeLogout(token, client_id, client_secret);
```

### config
This is your configuration object for the client. The config is passed into each of the methods with optional overrides.

- **action** - This specifies the objective that you want the user to accomplish currently, we support 'login' and 'register'. 
- **client_id** - The ID provided to you from [CycurID Portal Website](https://portal.cycurid.com/) see [Account Creation](#account-creation) for more details.

- **origin_url** - This is the URL that the request is initially used to initiate the OAuth process. This URL needs to match the provided URL associated with the client account. The widget response will be sent to this address.
